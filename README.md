# HW Graph and Linear Algebra

## Contents

### 1. Strongly Connected Components
- Implementation to find strongly connected components in a directed graph.
- Uses the standard C++ `stack` for the first depth-first traversal.

### 2. Matrix Transposition
- Function to compute the transpose of an integer matrix.
- Example using `vector<vector<int>>` matrices.

### 3. Dot Product of Vectors
- Calculation of the dot product between two vectors.
- Includes dimension checking and a practical example.
